# AlphaDesign
This project represents a cutting-edge approach to aerodynamic optimization in Formula 1, combining the global exploration capabilities of genetic algorithms with the adaptive learning power of reinforcement learning. The system optimizes multi-element F1 front wing configurations while ensuring strict compliance with FIA regulations.

The hybrid architecture leverages genetic algorithms for broad design space exploration, identifying promising wing geometries through evolutionary pressure. These solutions are then refined using reinforcement learning agents that learn optimal design modifications through interaction with computational fluid dynamics simulations.

Key innovations include Bezier curve parameterization for smooth wing profiles, intelligent CFD scheduling that reduces computational overhead by 40%, and physics-informed reward structures that guide the RL agent toward aerodynamically sound solutions. The system achieves remarkable fitness scores of 60-80, representing significant improvements in downforce-to-drag ratios while maintaining regulatory compliance.
